A collection of procedures for analysing, visualising, 
  and managing single-case data. These include regression models 
  (multilevel, multivariate, bayesian), between case smd, overlap indices 
  ('PND', 'PEM', 'PAND', 'PET', 'tau-u', 'IRD', 'baseline corrected tau', 'CDC'), 
  and randomization tests. Data preparation functions support outlier detection, 
  handling missing values, scaling, and custom transformations. 
  An export function helps to generate html, word, and latex tables in a 
  publication friendly style. A shiny app allows to use scan in a graphical 
  userinterface.
  More details can be found in the online book 'Analyzing single-case data with 
  R and scan', Juergen Wilbert (2025)
