\arguments{
\item{values}{A vector containing measurement values of the dependent
variable.}

\item{B_start}{The first measurement of phase B (simple coding if
design is strictly AB).}

\item{mt}{A vector defining measurement times. Default is \verb{mt = (1,2,3,...,n)}.}

\item{phase}{A vector defining phase assignments.}

\item{phase_design}{A list defining the length and label of
each phase. E.g., \code{phase_design = c(A1 = 10, B1 = 10, A2 = 10, B2 = 10)}.}

\item{phase_starts}{A vector defining the label and measurement time of each
phase start. E.g., \code{phase_starts = c(A1 = 1, B1 = 6, A2 = 14, B2 = 19)}.}

\item{name}{A name for the case.}

\item{dvar}{Character string with the name of the dependent variable.
Defaults to the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{pvar}{Character string with the name of the phase variable. Defaults to
the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{mvar}{Character string with the name of the measurement time variable.
Defaults to the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{...}{Additional variables. E.g., \verb{teacher = c(0,1,0,1,0,0,1), lesson = c(1,3,4,5,2,3)}.}
}
\value{
Returns a single-case data frame \code{scdf} suitable for all
functions of the \code{scan} package. Multiple data sets (e.g. from
Multiple Baseline Designs) can be listed.
}
\description{
\code{scdf()} is the constructor for the \code{scdf} class. It stores single-case study
data with one or more single-cases.
}
\details{
If the dependent variable is a named vector then the names are
extracted to create a phase design (e.g., \code{values = c(A = 2,3,5,4,3, B = 6,5,4,3)} will create an AB phase design with five and four measurements).
An scdf contains several attributes: \code{dvar} The name of the dependent
variable. \code{phase} The name of the phase variable. \code{mt} The name
of the measurement time variable. \code{author} Information on the author
of the data. \code{info} Further information on the data. E.g., a
publication. \verb{dvar, phase}, and \code{mt} are the defaults most of the
\code{scan} function use. You can change the values of the attributes with
the \code{scdf_attr} function (e.g., \code{scdf_attr(exampleAB_add, "dvar") <- "depression"} defines depression as the dependent variable. Please
notice that all \code{scan} functions have arguments to define \code{dvar},
\code{phase}, and \code{mt} for a given analysis.

## Scores on a letter naming task were collected on eleven days in a row.
## The intervention started after the fifth measurement,
## so the first B phase measurement was 6 (B_start = 6).
klaas <- scdf(
  c(5, 7, 8, 5, 7, 12, 16, 18, 15, 14, 19),
  B_start = 6, name = "Klaas"
)
describe(klaas)

# Alternative coding 1:
klaas <- scdf(
  c(A = 5, 7, 8, 5, 7, B = 12, 16, 18, 15, 14, 19),
  name = "Klaas"
)

# Alternative coding 2:
klaas <- scdf(
  c(5, 7, 8, 5, 7, 12, 16, 18, 15, 14, 19),
  phase_design = c(A = 5, B = 6), name = "Klaas"
)

## Unfortunately in a similar study there were no data collected on
## days 3 and 9. Use NA to pass them to the function:
emmi <- scdf(c(5, 7, NA, 5, 7, 12, 16, 18, NA, 14, 19),
  phase_design = c(A = 5, B = 6), name = "Emmi"
)
describe(emmi)

## In a MBD over three cases, data were collected eleven days in a row.
## Intervention starting points differ between subjects as they were
## randomly assigned. The three SCDFs are then combined in a list for
## further conjoined analyses.
charlotte <- scdf(c(A = 5, 7, 10, 5, 12, B = 7, 10, 18, 15, 14, 19))
theresa <- scdf(c(A = 3, 4, 3, 5, B = 7, 4, 7, 9, 8, 10, 12))
antonia <- scdf(c(A = 9, 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, B = 6, 14, 15, 12, 16))
mbd <- c(charlotte, theresa, antonia)
names(mbd) <- c("Charlotte", "Theresa", "Antonia")

## In a classroom-based intervention it was not possible to measure outcomes
## every day, but only on schooldays. The sequence of measurements is passed
## to the package by using a vector of measurement times.
frida <- scdf(
