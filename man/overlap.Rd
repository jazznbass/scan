\title{Overlap indices for single-case data}
\usage{
overlap(data, dvar, pvar, mvar, decreasing = FALSE, phases = c(1, 2))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A single-case data frame. See \code{\link[=scdf]{scdf()}} to learn about this
format.}

\item{dvar}{Character string with the name of the dependent variable.
Defaults to the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{pvar}{Character string with the name of the phase variable. Defaults to
the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{mvar}{Character string with the name of the measurement time variable.
Defaults to the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{decreasing}{If you expect data to be lower in the B phase, set
\code{decreasing = TRUE}. Default is \code{decreasing = FALSE}.}

\item{phases}{A vector of two characters or numbers indicating the two phases
that should be compared. E.g., \code{phases = c("A","C")} or \code{phases = c(2,4)}
for comparing the second to the fourth phase. Phases could be combined by
providing a list with two elements. E.g., \code{phases = list(A = c(1,3), B = c(2,4))} will compare phases 1 and 3 (as A) against 2 and 4 (as B). Default
is \code{phases = c(1,2)}.}

\value{
\tabular{ll}{
    \tab  \cr
   \code{overlap} \tab A data frame consisting of the following indices for each single-case for all cases: PND, PEM, PET, NAP, PAND, IRD, Tau-U (A vs. B - Trend A), Diff_mean, Diff_trend, SMD, Hedges-g. \cr
   \code{phases.A} \tab Selection for A phase. \cr
   \code{phases.B} \tab Selection for B phase. \cr
   \code{design} \tab Phase design. \cr

}
\description{
The \code{overlap} function provides the most common overlap indices for
single-case data and some additional statistics.
}
\details{
See corresponding functions of PND, PEM, PET, NAP, PAND for
calculation. Tau_U(A) reports "A vs. B - Trend A" whereas Tau_U(BA) reports
"A vs. B + Trend B - Trend A". Base_Tau is baseline corrected tau
(correction applied when autocorrelation in phase A is significant).
Diff_mean is the mean difference. Diff_trend is the difference in the
regression estimation of the dependent variable on measurement-time (\code{x ~ mt}) for each phase. SMD is the mean difference divided by the standard
deviation of phase A. Hedges_g is the mean difference divided by the pooled
standard deviation: \eqn{\sqrt{ (n_A - 1)sd_A^2 + (n_B - 1)sd_B^2 \over n_A
  + n_B - 2 }} with a hedges correction applied: \eqn{Hedges_g * (1 -
  \frac{3}{4n - 9} ) )}.

\examples{

## Display overlap indices for one single-case
overlap(Huitema2000, decreasing = TRUE)

## Display overlap indices for six single-cases
overlap(GruenkeWilbert2014)

## Combining phases for analyszing designs with more than two phases
overlap(exampleA1B1A2B2, phases = list(c("A1","A2"), c("B1","B2")))
