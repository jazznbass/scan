\title{Standardized mean differences}
\usage{
smd(data, dvar, pvar, mvar, phases = c(1, 2))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A single-case data frame. See \code{\link[=scdf]{scdf()}} to learn about this
format.}

\item{dvar}{Character string with the name of the dependent variable.
Defaults to the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{pvar}{Character string with the name of the phase variable. Defaults to
the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{mvar}{Character string with the name of the measurement time variable.
Defaults to the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{phases}{A vector of two characters or numbers indicating the two phases
that should be compared. E.g., \code{phases = c("A","C")} or \code{phases = c(2,4)}
for comparing the second to the fourth phase. Phases could be combined by
providing a list with two elements. E.g., \code{phases = list(A = c(1,3), B = c(2,4))} will compare phases 1 and 3 (as A) against 2 and 4 (as B). Default
is \code{phases = c(1,2)}.}
}
\description{
The \code{smd()} function provides various standardized mean effect sizes for
single-case data.
}
\details{
'sd cohen' is the (unweigted) average of the variance of phase A and
B. 'sd Hedges' is the weighted average of the variance of phase A and B
(with a degrees of freedom correction). 'Hedges' g' is the mean difference
divided by 'sd Hedges'. 'Hedges' g correction' and 'Hedges' g durlak
correction' are two approaches of correcting Hedges' g for small sample
sizes. 'Glass' delta' is the mean difference divided by the standard
deviation of the A-phase. 'Cohens d' is the mean difference divided by 'sd
cohen'.
