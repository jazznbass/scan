\usage{
nap(data, dvar, pvar, decreasing = FALSE, phases = c(1, 2))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A single-case data frame. See \code{\link[=scdf]{scdf()}} to learn about this
format.}

\item{dvar}{Character string with the name of the dependent variable.
Defaults to the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{pvar}{Character string with the name of the phase variable. Defaults to
the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{decreasing}{If you expect data to be lower in the B phase, set
\code{decreasing = TRUE}. Default is \code{decreasing = FALSE}.}

\item{phases}{A vector of two characters or numbers indicating the two phases
that should be compared. E.g., \code{phases = c("A","C")} or \code{phases = c(2,4)}
for comparing the second to the fourth phase. Phases could be combined by
providing a list with two elements. E.g., \code{phases = list(A = c(1,3), B = c(2,4))} will compare phases 1 and 3 (as A) against 2 and 4 (as B). Default
is \code{phases = c(1,2)}.}

\description{
The \code{\link[=nap]{nap()}} function calculates the nonoverlap of all pairs (NAP; Parker &
Vannest, 2009).  NAP summarizes the overlap between all pairs of phase A and
phase B data points.  If an increase of phase B scores is expected, a
non-overlapping pair has a higher phase B data point. The NAP equals
\emph{number of pairs showing no overlap / number of pairs} where ties are
counted as half non-overlaps.  Because NAP can take values between 0 and 100
percent where values below 50 percent indicate an inverse effect, an nap
rescaled from -100 to 100 percent where negative
values indicate an inverse effect is also displayed (\eqn{nap_{rescaled} = 2
* nap - 100}).
}
\examples{

## Calculate NAP for a study with  lower expected phase B scores
## (e.g. aggressive behavior)
gretchen <- scdf(c(A = 12, 14, 9, 10, B = 10, 6, 4, 5, 3, 4))
nap(gretchen, decreasing = TRUE)

## Request NAP for all cases from the Grosche2011 scdf
nap(Grosche2011)
