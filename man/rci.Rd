\title{Reliable change index}
\usage{
rci(data, dvar, pvar, rel, ci = 0.95, graph = FALSE, phases = c(1, 2))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A single-case data frame. See \code{\link[=scdf]{scdf()}} to learn about this
format.}

\item{dvar}{Character string with the name of the dependent variable.
Defaults to the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{pvar}{Character string with the name of the phase variable. Defaults to
the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{rel}{Reliability of the measure, used to compute the standard error.}

\item{ci}{Width of confidence interval as a decimal. Default is \code{ci = 0.95}
applying a 95 percent confidence interval.}

\item{graph}{If set \code{TRUE}, a box plot of phase A and B scores is displayed.
\code{graph = FALSE} by default.}

\item{phases}{A vector of two characters or numbers indicating the two phases
that should be compared. E.g., \code{phases = c("A","C")} or \code{phases = c(2,4)}
for comparing the second to the fourth phase. Phases could be combined by
providing a list with two elements. E.g., \code{phases = list(A = c(1,3), B = c(2,4))} will compare phases 1 and 3 (as A) against 2 and 4 (as B). Default
is \code{phases = c(1,2)}.}
}
\description{
The \code{rci()} function computes indices of reliable change (Wise, 2004)
and corresponding descriptive statistics.

\examples{

## Report the RCIs of the first case from the byHeart data and include a graph
rci(byHeart2011[1], graph = TRUE, rel = 0.8)
