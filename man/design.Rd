\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of cases to be designed (Default is \code{n = 1}).}

\item{phase_design, phase.design}{A list defining the length and label of each
phase. E.g., \code{phase.length = list(A1 = 10, B1 = 10, A2 = 10, B2 = 10)}. Use
vectors if you want to define different values for each case \verb{phase.length = list(A = c(10, 15), B = c(10, 15)}.}

\item{trend}{Defines the effect size of a trend added incrementally to each
measurement across the whole data-set. To assign different trends to
several single-cases, use a vector of values (e.g. \code{trend = c(.1, .3, .5)}). If the number of cases exceeds the length of the vector, values are
recycled. When using a 'gaussian' distribution, the \code{trend} parameters
indicate effect size
\emph{d} changes.  When using a binomial or poisson distribution, \code{trend}
indicates an increase in points / counts per measurement.}

\item{level}{A list that defines the level increase (effect size \emph{d}) at the
beginning of each phase relative to the previous phase (e.g. \code{list(A = 0, B = 1)}). The first element must be zero as the first phase of a single-case
has no level effect (if you have one less list element than the number of
phases, scan will add a leading element with 0 values). Use vectors to
define variable level effects for each case (e.g. \code{list(A = c(0, 0), B = c(1, 2))}). When using a 'gaussian' distribution, the \code{level} parameters
indicate effect size \emph{d} changes. When using a binomial or poisson
distribution, \code{level} indicates an increase in points / counts with the
onset of each phase.}

\item{slope}{A list that defines the increase per measurement for each phase
compared to the previous phase. \code{slope = list(A = 0, B = .1)} generates an
incremental increase of 0.1 per measurement starting at the B phase. The
first list element must be zero as the first phase of a single-case has no
slope effect (if you have one less list element than the number of phases,
scan will add a leading element with 0 values). Use vectors to define
variable slope effects for each case (e.g. \code{list(A = c(0, 0), B = c(0.1, 0.2))}). If the number of cases exceeds the length of the vector, values
are recycled. When using a 'gaussian' distribution, the \code{slope} parameters
indicate effect size \emph{d} changes per measurement. When using a binomial or
poisson distribution, \code{slope} indicates an increase in points / counts per
measurement.}

\item{start_value, m}{Starting value at the first measurement. Default is
\code{50}. When \code{distribution = "poission"} the start_value represents
frequency. When \code{distribution = "binomial"} start_value must range between
0 and 1 and they represent the probability of on event. To assign different
start values to several single-cases, use a vector of values (e.g. \code{c(50, 42, 56)}). If the number of cases exceeds the length of the vector, values
are recycled. The \code{m} argument is deprecated.}

\item{s}{Standard deviation used to calculate absolute values from level,
slope, trend effects and to calculate and error distribution from the \code{rtt}
values. Set to \code{10} by default. To assign different variances to several
single-cases, use a vector of values (e.g. \code{s = c(5, 10, 15)}). If the
number of cases exceeds the length of the vector, values are recycled. if
the distribution is 'poisson' or 'binomial' s is not applied.}

\item{rtt}{Reliability of the underlying simulated measurements. Set \code{rtt = .8} by default. To assign different reliabilities to several single-cases,
use a vector of values (e.g. \code{rtt = c(.6, .7, .8)}). If the number of cases
exceeds the length of the vector, values are repeated. \code{rtt} has no effect
when you're using binomial or poisson distributions.}

\item{extreme_prop, extreme.p}{Probability of extreme values. \code{extreme.p = .05} gives a five percent probability of an extreme value. A vector of
values assigns different probabilities to multiple cases. If the number of
cases exceeds the length of the vector, values are recycled.}

\item{extreme_range, extreme.d}{Range for extreme values. \code{extreme_range = c(-7,-6)} uses extreme values within a range of -7 and -6 . In case of a
binomial or poisson distribution, \code{extreme_range} indicates frequencies. In
case of a gaussian (or normal) distribution it indicates effect size d.
Caution: the first value must be smaller than the second, otherwise the
procedure will fail.}

\item{missing_prop, missing.p}{Portion of missing values. \code{missing_prop = 0.1}
creates 10\\% of all values as missing). A vector of values assigns
different probabilities to multiple cases. If the number of cases exceeds
the length of the vector, values are repeated.}

\item{distribution}{Distribution of the criteria varible. Default is
\code{"normal"}. Possible values are \code{"normal"}, \code{"binomial"}, and \code{"poisson"}.}

\item{random_start_value}{If TRUE, the start_values are randomized based on
the distribution.}

\item{n_trials}{If \code{distribution} (see below) is \code{"binomial"}, \code{n_trials} is
the number of trials/observations/items.}

\item{mt, MT}{Number of measurements (in each study). Default is \code{mt = 20}.}

\item{B_start, B.start}{Phase B starting point. The default setting \code{B_start = 6} would assign the first five scores (of each case) to phase A, and all
following scores to phase B. To assign different starting points for a set
of multiple single-cases, use a vector of starting values (e.g., \code{B_start = c(6, 7, 8)}). If the number of cases exceeds the length of the vector,
values will be recycled.}
