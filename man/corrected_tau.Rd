\usage{
corrected_tau(
  data,
  dvar,
  pvar,
  mvar,
  phases = c(1, 2),
  alpha = 0.05,
  continuity = FALSE,
  repeated = FALSE,
  tau_method = c("b", "a")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A single-case data frame. See \code{\link[=scdf]{scdf()}} to learn about this
format.}

\item{dvar}{Character string with the name of the dependent variable.
Defaults to the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{pvar}{Character string with the name of the phase variable. Defaults to
the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{mvar}{Character string with the name of the measurement time variable.
Defaults to the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{phases}{A vector of two characters or numbers indicating the two phases
that should be compared. E.g., \code{phases = c("A","C")} or \code{phases = c(2,4)}
for comparing the second to the fourth phase. Phases could be combined by
providing a list with two elements. E.g., \code{phases = list(A = c(1,3), B = c(2,4))} will compare phases 1 and 3 (as A) against 2 and 4 (as B). Default
is \code{phases = c(1,2)}.}

\item{alpha}{Sets the p-value at and below which a baseline correction is
applied.}

\item{continuity}{If TRUE applies a continuity correction for calculating p}

\item{repeated}{If TRUE applies the repeated median method for calculating
slope and intercept.}

\item{tau_method}{Character with values "a" or "b" (default) indicating
whether Kendall Tau A or Kendall Tau B is applied.}

\description{
Kendall's tau correlation for the dependent variable and the phase variable
is calculated after correcting for a baseline trend.
}
\details{
This method has been proposed by Tarlow (2016). The baseline data
are checked for a significant autocorrelation (based on Kendall's Tau). If
so, a non-parametric Theil-Sen regression is applied for the baseline data
where the dependent values are regressed on the measurement time. The
resulting slope information is then used to predict data of the B-phase.
The dependent variable is now corrected for this baseline trend and the
residuals of the Theil-Sen regression are taken for further calculations.
Finally, Kendall's tau is calculated for the dependent variable and the
dichotomous phase variable. The function here provides two extensions to
this procedure: The more accurate Siegel repeated median regression is
applied when \code{repeated = TRUE} and a continuity correction is applied when
\code{continuity = TRUE}.
