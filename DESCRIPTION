Description: A collection of procedures for analysing, visualising, 
  and managing single-case data. These include piecewise linear regression 
  models, multilevel models, overlap indices (PND, PEM, PAND, PET, tauU, 
  baseline corrected tau), and randomization tests. Data preparation functions 
  support outlier detection, handling missing values, scaling, truncating, 
  rank transormation, and smoothing. An exporting function help to generate 
  html and latex tables in a publication friendly style. More details can be
